# hello-world

So this is my first repository.

I'm brand new to coding, and intend to make full use of GitHub and all it has to offer in 2018. 

I am currently working as a Content Author (Technical Writer lite) and intend to upskill in Web Dev, as well as more general software engineering this year.
